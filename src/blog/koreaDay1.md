After my plane decided to graciously land at 3:30 AM, a whole 1.5 hours before its scheduled arrival time, there was barely anything open (as expected). I finally headed to Seoul Station around 5 AM to meet with my friend who had arrived the day before, and we decided to get breakfast inside the station at a fast-food place called Lotteria.
